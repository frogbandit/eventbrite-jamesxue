**Eventbrite Intern Challenge: Data Visualization.** Visualized events on Eventbrite by location on a map, and dates on a calendar. 

Made using the [Eventbrite API](https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/), specifically using Events and Venues, by **James Xue**. Tools used: Python, Flask, Eventbrite API, D3.js, and DataMaps. Lots of credit to [Calendar View](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318) by Mike Bostock, and [this particular DataMaps example](https://github.com/markmarkoh/datamaps/blob/master/src/examples/highmaps_world.html). 

Live version is available at **[eventbrite-jamesxue.herokuapp.com](https://eventbrite-jamesxue.herokuapp.com/)**.
If you have any questions, reach out to me [via email](mailto:james.xue@columbia.edu). 
Note: The site will take a few seconds to load, because of requests made to Eventbrite Venues.
